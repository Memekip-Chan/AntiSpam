# AntiSpam

The scripts in this repo are made to attempt to block spam on reddit. This is ultimately a futile endeavor as spammers will always think of new ways to peddle their products and avoid detection, but it is a fun programming challenge to try and tackle these problems as they come!

Be sure to evaluate these scripts for yourself before deploying them long term to be sure there's no security risks, as these are mostly just short term scripts that took no more than an hour or two to develop
